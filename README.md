===================
 PHP to HTML
===================

A simple script to convert sites created in PHP using header and footer files to a more universal HTML format.

The script processes any PHP files and saves the out put, so header and footer files are effectively processed. It also replaces .php files extensions with .html.

Usage
===============
./php_to_html.py [source dir] [destination dir]
